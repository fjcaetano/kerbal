# This is my save for the [Kebal Space Program](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/).

I'm currently using the 0.18.4 version (latest).

Feel free to explore it and suggest modifications.

I'm currently using no mods and no add ons.

# Ships

## MünRover
This ship is a rover landed on the Mün. Unfortunately, it's rear propeller broke on the landing, but it's still drivable through RCS.

## Icarus
The Icarus was my first satellite that I managed to put in orbit. It's orbiting eliptically at ~ 45º with Pe = 108.976Km and Ap = 604.739Km.

It's self sufficient in matters of electricity and it has enough fuel to return to Kerbin, though there are no parachutes.

It's ugly and useless, but it's up there for sentimental values.

## The KSS
The Kerbal Space Station aka KSS is orbiting at 90º at 300Km. It's orbit was calculated to match with the Mün's orbit and it serve as a pitstop in the trajectory.

It can support up to 13 Kerbals, though, currently 7 is the suggested number since it's the capability of it's safe return module (Leonardo II).

The current crew:

- Jebediah Kerman
- Flavio Kaetano (that's me!)
- Bob Kerman
- Mactrey Kerman
- Dercan Kerman

The KSS is composed of the following modules:

### The Core
The Core was built upon the Space Station Core (Stock), but it's orbiting with an empty fuel tank and a propeller.

### The KSS/EM1
The KSS Eletric Module 1 is a giant electric module (duh) with 12 Gigantor XL Solar panels, though 4 remain closed for backup purposes. It also contains a shitload of batteries which take it's electric capability up to 8000 Electric Units.

### Leonardo II
This is the safe return module. It has 7 seats for Kerbal spacemen and enough fuel to safely return to Kerbin.

I think I may build a Leonardo III to be able to bring more Kerbals home, if necessary.

### Goliath II
The Goliath II is the fuelling module. It's composed by a Rockomax Jumbo-64 Fuel Tank and a Rockomax x200-32 Fuel Tank. It's capability is of 4320 Fuel Units (holy guacamole!) and it currently has 4209 Fuel Units. It's almost full.

The rocket to lift it up there was so huge I had to call it Goliath… the second.
