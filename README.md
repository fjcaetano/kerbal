# This is my save for the [Kebal Space Program](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/).

I'm currently using the 0.18.4 version (latest).

Feel free to explore it and suggest modifications.

The only mod I'm using is MechJeb.

# Ships & Flights In Progress

## Icarus
The Icarus was my first satellite that I managed to put in orbit. It's orbiting eliptically at ~ 45º with Pe = 108.976Km and Ap = 604.739Km.

It's self sufficient in matters of electricity and it has enough fuel to return to Kerbin, though there are no parachutes.

It's ugly and useless, but it's up there for sentimental values.

## The KSS
The Kerbal Space Station aka KSS is orbiting at 90º at 300Km. It's orbit was calculated to match with the Mün's orbit and it serve as a pitstop in the trajectory.

It can support up to 20 Kerbals, though, currently 15 is the suggested number since it's the capability of it's safe return module (Kilton).

The current crew:

- Jebediah Kerman
- Flavio Kaetano (that's me!)
- Barrod Kerman
- Alvis Kerman
- Shepcas Kerman
- Dercan Kerman

Old crew (successfully returned):

- Bob Kerman
- Mactrey Kerman
- Dercan Kerman

The KSS is composed of the following modules:

### The Core
The Core was built upon the Space Station Core (Stock), but it's orbiting with an empty fuel tank and a propeller.

### The KSS/EM1
The KSS Eletric Module 1 is a giant electric module (duh) with 12 Gigantor XL Solar panels, though 4 remain closed for backup purposes. It also contains a shitload of batteries which take it's electric capability up to 8000 Electric Units.

### Goliath II
The Goliath II is the fuelling module. It's composed by a Rockomax Jumbo-64 Fuel Tank and a Rockomax x200-32 Fuel Tank. It's capability is of 4320 Fuel Units (holy guacamole!) and it currently has 4209 Fuel Units. It's almost full.

The rocket to lift it up there was so huge I had to call it Goliath… the second.

### Hydra I
A probe scatter module! The 4 probes are composed by batteries, two Gigantor Solar Panels, and Ion Propellers. They're super fun, though not very useful and quite impossible to redock...

### Kilton
The Kilton is not only Kerbal's Space Hotel, but it's also a safe return module. It has capacity for 15 Kerbals to safely return to Kerbin.

## MunBase

The MunBase is located at the coordinates 0º 42' 5" N, 2º 45' 2" E of the Mun at 300m of the Neil Armstrong memorial (almost pure luck).

Crew:

- Barrod Kerman
- Mactrey Kerman
- Alvis Kerman

### The Kolumbus
My first manned lander explorer ship. The main module of the MunBase. Theorically, has enough fuel to safely return to Kerbin.

### MünRover II
This ugly-ass unmanned rover is currently using a liquid fuel propeller, but, when the fuel is over, it can be propelled by three Ion Propellers. It has a shitload of batteries, two Xenon tanks and had 4 Gigantor Solar Pannels, though only 3 are "openable" when in rover mode and one already broke, so there are only two usable.


# Obsolete Ships

### Leonardo II
Was KSS first safe return module. It had 7 seats for Kerbal spacemen and enough fuel to safely return to Kerbin.

Safely returned home with Bob, Mactrey and Dercan Kerman who were too terrified to keep in space.

## MünRover
This ship was a rover landed on the Mün. Unfortunately, it's rear propeller broke on the landing, but it was still drivable through RCS.

It was discontinued when it flipped, braking it's solar panels and a landing gear that made it unmanuverable.
